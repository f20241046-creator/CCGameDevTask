Creative Feature:
I added gold coin collectibles to the game. These coins are placed along the track for the player to collect while running. Collecting a coin increases the playerâ€™s score in real time, giving the game a stronger sense of progression and reward. This feature adds an extra layer of challenge and engagement, as players are encouraged not only to avoid obstacles but also to aim for higher scores by collecting coins along the way.
